applicative order / substitution model 
1. use applicative order 
#(test 0 (p))
#(test 0 p)
#(if( = 0 0 ) 0 p)
#(if( true ) 0 p)
#0
the applicative order will not work, because it will call (p) indefinitely and we will never get the result

2. use normal order 
(test 0 (p))
(if(= 0 0) 0 (p))
(if( true) 0 (p))
0
; normal order has no problem because it will never call (p) method
